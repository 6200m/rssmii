# RSSMii

RSSMii allows you to get updates from RSS feeds straight to your Wii. You will get the updates on your Wii Message Board.

It reads a "feeds.xml" file on your SD Card root to subscribe you to each feed listed. So you can update it at any time, then launch RSSMii again and it'll update your subscriptions.
